This directory contains copies of a variety of documents related to the
ILOC Front End assignment in COMP 412.

Lab1TimingGraph.xlsx - an Excel (r) spreadsheet that will plot the results
of a timing test to show the measured runtimes on the SLOCs timing blocks.

NoteOnTarFiles.pdf - a brief explanation of what should be in a tar archive
submitted for grading and how to build such an archive.

TimingPlots.pdf - a discussion of the timing plot produced by the spreadsheet.
If you wrote your lab in Java, you should read the discussion about the impact
of the Java JIT (the HotSpot(R) Server Compiler) on the apparent timing results.
